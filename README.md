## The classic computerized table tennis game!

Just for the sake of building something fun, I recreated Pong, the universal classic video game. It was made using the LibGDX libraries, and that helped spin up the game really fast. Right now the game has a nice variable frame rate depending on the device you are using and it will VSync to your monitor. There are instructions on screen to see immediately how to play. The scores will update correctly, and the paddles won't drift off screen, but there is not currently a winning score. Just unlimited **PONG**! Being my first time using LibGDX's framework, I wanted to make something really simple so I could get the hang of using the libraries and getting straight to deployment.

## Gameplay

Right now this game is designed for two players sitting at the same computer. Use the **A** and **D** keys to control the paddle up top, and **←** and **→** arrow keys to control the paddle on the bottom. 

## How to Run

In the releases section you'll find a .zip folder for most desktop OSes. Download the .zip, extract it wherever you want to keep it on your computer and then run the executable file (whichever one for your respective OS).
